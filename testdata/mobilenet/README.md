# MobileNet

MobileNets are a family of lightweight deep neural network architectures designed for efficient performance on mobile and embedded devices. They use depthwise separable convolutions to drastically reduce the number of parameters and computational cost, while maintaining high accuracy for tasks like image classification and object detection.
